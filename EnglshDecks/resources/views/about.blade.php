            I have been studying English for a long time and use one application that helps me learn new words and remember them. But I was annoyed that in such applications there are a lot of advertisements that ruin the comfort of learning new words. Without thinking, I decided that the application was not so complicated that I could make a similar website, maybe not as beautiful, because I am not a designer, but I think that from a code point of view, it is possible to do it for an inexperienced programmer like me.
